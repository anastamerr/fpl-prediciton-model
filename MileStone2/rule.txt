Defender scoring rule (Python)
--------------------------------
```python
def calculate_defender_points(props):
    minutes = int(props.get("minutes", 0))
    playing_points = 0 if minutes == 0 else 1 if minutes < 60 else 2
    assist_points = int(props.get("assists", 0)) * 3
    penalty_miss_points = int(props.get("penalties_missed", 0)) * -2
    own_goal_points = int(props.get("own_goals", 0)) * -2
    yellow_card_points = int(props.get("yellow_cards", 0)) * -1
    red_card_points = int(props.get("red_cards", 0)) * -3
    bonus_points = int(props.get("bonus", 0))
    goal_points = int(props.get("goals_scored", 0)) * 6
    clean_sheet_points = 4 if int(props.get("clean_sheets", 0)) > 0 and minutes > 60 else 0
    goals_conceded_points = -(int(props.get("goals_conceded", 0)) // 2)
    return (
        playing_points
        + assist_points
        + penalty_miss_points
        + own_goal_points
        + yellow_card_points
        + red_card_points
        + bonus_points
        + goal_points
        + clean_sheet_points
        + goals_conceded_points
    )
```

Detection workflow (used inside create_kg.py)
1. Identify players with multiple positions where one is `DEF`:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_AS]->(pos:Position)
   WITH p, COLLECT(pos.name) AS positions
   WHERE 'DEF' IN positions AND size(positions) > 1
   RETURN p.player_name AS player_name, p.player_element AS player_element, positions
   ```
2. For each candidate, fetch every `PLAYED_IN` relation with its season/fixture:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (p:Player {player_name: $player_name, player_element: $player_element})-[r:PLAYED_IN]->(f:Fixture)
   MATCH (f)<-[:HAS_FIXTURE]-(gw:Gameweek)<-[:HAS_GW]-(s:Season)
   RETURN s.season_name AS season, f.fixture_number AS fixture_number, r AS rel
   ORDER BY s.season_name, f.fixture_number
   ```
3. In Python, compute `def_score = calculate_defender_points(rel)` for each fixture and
   flag any fixture where `def_score != rel["total_points"]`.
4. Report per player:
   ```json
   {
     "player": "Player Name",
     "not_def_fixtures": <count>,
     "total_fixtures": <count>,
     "fixture_details": [
       {
         "season": "...",
         "fixture_number": 160,
         "total_points": 1,
         "def_score": 0,
         "matches_def": false
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
