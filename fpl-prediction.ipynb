    "- **Popularity metrics** (selected, transfers_in/out): Reflect manager behavior, not player performance. Including these would create data leakage as they're influenced by future expectations.\n",
    "- **Match identifiers** (element, fixture, round): Administrative data with no predictive value.\n",
    "- **Temporal data** (kickoff_time): Time of day doesn't significantly impact FPL points.\n",
    "- **Match context** (opponent_team, was_home, scores): While potentially useful, these add complexity and our focus is on player-level performance patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing value strategy:**\n",
    "- Numeric columns filled with 0: Represents \"no contribution\" (e.g., 0 goals, 0 assists)\n",
    "- This is appropriate for FPL data where absence of an event means zero points for that category\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we sort by season, player, and gameweek:**\n",

    "### Data Engineering Questions - Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1: Position Analysis\n",
    "**Finding:** The analysis reveals which positions score the highest average points across all seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- Midfielders and Forwards typically score higher average points due to goals/assists\n",
    "- Defenders score more consistently (clean sheets) but with lower ceilings\n",
    "- Goalkeepers have the most consistent but lowest average points\n",
    "- Box plot shows forwards have highest variance (boom or bust performances)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for modeling:**\n",
    "- Position must be included as a feature (encoded categorically)\n",
    "- Different positions require different evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Defender predictions should emphasize clean_sheets, forwards should emphasize goals_scored\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2: Performance Evolution (2022-23 Season)\n",
    "**Finding:** Top performers by total points vs. top by form metric show interesting patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- Players with highest total points aren't always \"in form\" every week\n",
    "- Form metric (4-week rolling average) captures hot/cold streaks\n",
    "- Consistency matters: Some players score fewer total points but maintain steady form\n",
    "- Form trends show momentum: Good form often continues for 2-3 gameweeks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for modeling:**\n",
    "- Form feature is valuable for capturing recent performance trends\n",
    "- Historical total points alone insufficient - recent form better predicts next week\n",
    "- Model should weight recent performance (form) alongside current gameweek stats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering Decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Form Feature Creation:**\n",
    "- 4-week window chosen to balance recency vs. statistical stability\n",
    "- Divided by 10 to normalize scale (typical FPL points per gameweek: 0-15)\n",
    "- Rolling calculation respects player-season boundaries\n",
    "- Captures momentum without being too reactive to single-game anomalies\n"

    "### Feature Selection Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these features were selected:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Match Performance Features:\n",
    "1. **goals_scored**: Direct indicator of offensive contribution. In FPL scoring, goals are heavily weighted (4-6 points depending on position).\n",
    "2. **assists**: Measures playmaking ability. Each assist awards 3 points in FPL.\n",
    "3. **minutes**: Playing time is fundamental - players must be on the pitch to score points. Strong predictor of availability and fitness.\n",
    "4. **clean_sheets**: Critical for defenders and goalkeepers (4-6 points). Indicates defensive solidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Player Quality Metrics:\n",
    "5. **creativity**: FPL metric measuring chance creation quality. Players with high creativity consistently contribute to goal-scoring opportunities.\n",
    "6. **influence**: Captures overall impact on match outcomes. High-influence players are involved in key moments.\n",
    "7. **value**: Player cost reflects expected performance. More expensive players typically deliver higher returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Engineered Features:\n",
    "8. **form**: Rolling 4-week average captures recent performance trends. Players in good form tend to maintain momentum.\n",
    "9. **position**: Different positions have different scoring patterns (forwards score more goals, defenders get clean sheet bonuses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these features work together:**\n",
    "- **Recent performance** (form) + **current gameweek stats** = Strong predictor of next week\n",
    "- **Quality metrics** (creativity, influence) provide context beyond raw statistics\n",
    "- **Position** accounts for role-based scoring differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features excluded:**\n",
    "- Popularity metrics (transfers_in, selected_by_percent): These reflect manager decisions, not player performance\n",
    "- Match context (opponent, home/away): These add complexity without proportional predictive gain for this model\n"

    "\n",
    "**Statistical ML Model Choice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Regularization Benefits:**\n",
    "- Ridge adds L2 penalty to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- Handles multicollinearity between features (e.g., creativity and influence are correlated)\n",
    "- Shrinks coefficients of less important features without eliminating them\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Interpretability:**\n",
    "- Coefficients directly show feature importance and direction of impact\n",
    "- Linear relationship is intuitive: \"Each additional goal increases predicted points by X\"\n",
    "- Easier to explain to stakeholders compared to black-box models\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "- Fast training on large datasets (multiple seasons of player data)\n",
    "- Quick inference for real-time predictions\n",
    "- Scales well with additional features\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Regression Problem Nature:**\n",
    "- FPL points are continuous values (0-20+ range)\n",
    "- Linear relationships exist: more goals → more points, more minutes → more points\n",
    "- Ridge captures these linear trends while handling noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alpha = 1.0 choice:**\n",
    "- Moderate regularization strength\n",
    "- Balances model complexity with predictive power\n",
    "- Can be tuned via cross-validation for optimal performance\n"
