# Remaining Limitations
- Team-level analytics are approximate because the KG lacks explicit Player→Team relationships for PLAYED_IN stats.
- Embedding search is season-agnostic; no per-season embedding variants or filters.
- Graph visualization is placeholder-level until real subgraphs (fixtures/teams/players) are piped in.
- LLM evaluation not yet executed; quantitative/qualitative benchmarks still to be run and documented.
- UI lacks full polishing (styling, legends for graph viz, richer recommendation justification).
